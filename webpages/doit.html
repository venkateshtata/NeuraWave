	<font size="5"> <font color="white"> Our brain is made of approximately 100 billion nerve cells, called neurons. Neurons have the amazing ability to gather and transmit electrochemical signals -- think of them like the gates and wires in a computer.

	<font size="5"> <font color="white"> Brain waves change according to what we’re doing and feeling. When slower brainwave is dominant, we can feel slow, sluggish, dreamy or tired.And when faster brainwave is dominant, we can feel wired or hyper-alert. Multiple brain waves may occur at the same time but there is only one brainwave that is dominant.  </font>

	<font size="5"> <font color="white"> Our headset can sense the EEG activity inside a person’s brain and give to our Artificial Intelligence. The technique works if Electrodes are placed on the surface of someone’s head. These electrodes can measure the electrical signals produced by the brain's neurons through the scalp.

	<font size="5"> <font color="white"> EEG has been used to help amputees control high-tech prosthetic limbs. Patients with spinal cord injuries or ALS could potentially use the technology to mobilize their wheelchairs or better communicate. As more wearable technologies emerge that claim to quantify our biology, it’s only expected that devices would be created to tap into our brains.
    Our controls work like this, users can "train" our Artificial Intelligence by thinking of certain objects or motions over and over; this allows the it to pick up the patterns associated with each thought. You can think 'fly' or think about something that you can recall with clarity. "You can think about pushing, think about the colour blue. Our AI is looking for that specific pattern.
